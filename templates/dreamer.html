        <h1>Your Financial Health: Poor</h1>
        <p>
            A dreamer is someone who has the desire to improve financial control, 
            but does not know exactly how much he or she earns and spends. 
            By not having clear goals due to a lack of planning, he or she expects
            external short-term solutions and forgets that financial life is the result
            of personal decisions and long-term attitudes.
        </p> 
        <p>
            He or she does not always save
            or invest appropriately due to a lack of knowledge of financial product options.
