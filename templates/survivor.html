        <h1>Your Financial Health: Very Poor</h1>
        <p>
            A survivor lives day to day, constantly facing challenges to meet basic needs. 
            The lack of stable income or financial control makes planning difficult, leading
            them to rely on short-term solutions like loans, external assistance, or emergency resources.
            While they aspire to improve their situation, they often lack knowledge about financial tools 
            and strategies to turn things around. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            For you, the first step is to create a simple budget, 
            prioritize essential expenses, and seek basic information on managing their finances better.
