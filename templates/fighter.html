    <h1>Your Financial Health: stable</h1>
    <p>A fighter is aware that dreams require sacrifices. 
        In addition to recording expenses to have greater control when spending,
        he or she has short-term goals such as paying off debts and reducing expenses
        to have more money at the end of the month. Although sometimes there is money left over ðŸ’µ, 
        it is not always saved or invested in the right way due to a lack of knowledge of financial product options.</p>
